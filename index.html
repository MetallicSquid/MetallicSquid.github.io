					<p><a href="https://alphafold.com/">AlphaFold</a> an AI model developed by <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> used for protein structure prediction. It is said that the models that AlphaFold generates are "far" more accurate than any previous method in the field.</p>
					<p><i>Protein folding</i> is a cellular process that folds proteins into very specific, three-dimensional shapes. The proteins need to be folded into the correct shape in order to function correctly. Malformed proteins contribute to many devastating genetic diseases like:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/">Altzheimer's</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/parkinsons-disease/">Parkinson's</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/huntingtons-disease/">Huntington's</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cystic-fibrosis/">Cystic Fibrosis</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Protein structure prediction methods, like AlphaFold, are essential for research on the functionality of proteins in biological systems, as well as in the diagnosis and potential treatment of the above genetic diseases.</p>
